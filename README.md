# Adaptive Assessment Simulation — 10-Day Predictive Hiring Experiment

### A Data Science Simulation to Improve Assessment Predictive Power

---

## Project Overview

This is a work-in-progess project simulating a **10-day hiring pipeline** where a company must onboard candidates quickly while improving the predictive accuracy of its assessment.  
The main question:  
> _Does performance on the assessment predict real-world project outcomes?_

Using **Item Response Theory (IRT)** and **machine learning**, this simulation models how assessments can be tuned daily to better identify top performers — just like a data-driven talent acquisition system.

---

## Objectives

- Simulate an assessment and project outcome scenario for 300+ candidates.
- Estimate item difficulty, discrimination, and candidate ability using **IRT**.
- Measure correlations between assessment results and project performance.
- Iteratively **refine** the assessment over 10 simulated days.
- Build an **ML predictor** to track how accuracy improves as the test evolves.

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Data Simulation
- Generate:
  - 300 candidates
  - 50 questions across 3 skill types  
- Assign true latent ability θ for each candidate  
- Simulate responses using a **2-Parameter Logistic IRT model (2PL)**:  
  $\( P(R_{j,i}=1) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-a_i(\theta_j - b_i)}} \)$

### Step 2 — IRT Modeling
- Fit the 2PL model to estimate:
  - `a_i`: discrimination (how well a question separates strong from weak candidates)
  - `b_i`: difficulty (how hard the question is)
  - `θ_j`: estimated ability per candidate  
- Evaluate correlation between θ̂ and project quality (low / medium / high) using **Spearman’s ρ**.

### Step 3 — Adaptive Refinement (Days 3–6)
- Identify weak or redundant items (too easy, too hard, or low discrimination).
- Adjust item parameters or simulate replacements.
- Re-simulate responses for new candidates and re-fit the model.

### Step 4 — Continuous Evaluation (Days 7–10)
- Repeat estimation → adjustment → simulation.
- Track how the correlation between assessment and project performance improves.

### Step 5 — Predictive Modeling
- Use estimated ability θ and skill-type scores as features.
- Train an **ordinal logistic regression** and **random forest** to predict project outcomes.
- Measure predictive performance (accuracy, macro-F1) over 10 simulated days.
